## Acknowledgement
This project is heavily based on [salt-lint](https://github.com/warpnet/salt-lint), with modifications by Thomas de Jong.  
Salt-lint itself is largely based on [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint), originally created by [Will Thames](https://github.com/willthames) and now maintained as part of [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com).  
The modified work on salt-lint was done by [Warpnet B.V.](https://github.com/warpnet).
